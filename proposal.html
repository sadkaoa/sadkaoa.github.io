    <h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>

    <p>
        I will be recreating and revamping my portfolio website with my graphic and web design work. I will be using Sqaurespace to completely rebrand my style and self to potential employers. I have many pieces of collateral and social media ad campaigns from various jobs/classes and other past experiences that I feel I need to better showcase in order to land a successful job and kickstart my career after graduation. It is something that is long overdue, considering the first portfolio website I made I was only a sophomore in college and since then have only added just a few samples of work. </p>

        <p>Like I mentioned before, my target auidence is that of prospective employers. I want to work for a company that is primarily looking to hire someone proficent in the Adobe suite and that understands graphic design. Though I code for websites, it is not my primary focus at this time and I have an overall stronger grasp on graphic design.</p>

    <p>I hope to have my Plan for the Project/Ux Research completed within the next week, my UX Design and Prototyping done in two weeks and my final deliverables done the first week of March. </p>
