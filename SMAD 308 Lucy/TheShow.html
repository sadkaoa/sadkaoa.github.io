    <li class="list-group-item">"I Love Lucy", an American television situation comedy that aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System (now CBS Corporation) from 1951 to 1957 and was the most popular show in America for four of its six prime-time seasons. The series won five Emmy Awards, including best situation comedy (1953, 1954) and best actress (Lucille Ball, 1956). I Love Lucy centred on the lives of Lucy Ricardo (played by Lucille Ball) and her bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (played by Ball’s real-life husband, Desi Arnaz). Lucy Ricardo is the wacky wife of Cuban bandleader Ricky Ricardo. Living in New York, Ricky tries to succeed in show business while Lucy -- always trying to help -- usually manages to get in some kind of trouble that drives Ricky crazy. Their best friends are Fred (William Frawley) and Ethel (Vivian Vance) Mertz, who are also their landlords. Usually, Ethel becomes Lucy's less-than-willing partner in crime. Ricky and Lucy welcomed little Ricky in 1953, whose birth was a national TV event. Later in the show's run, the Ricardos (and the Mertzes) moved to Hollywood, where Ricky tried to become a movie star.</li>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>1. The shooting of I Love Lucy:</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">There’s no doubt about it, I Love Lucy was a groundbreaking moment in 1950s US television. It became the first television series to use the three-camera format (which will be expounded later in this article), which led to becoming a standard technique in filming TV sitcoms. Three-hundred audience members attended every episode taping. They filmed the entire episode from start to finish, and they rarely had to re-tape the scenes. Not even once did every cast member ad-lib on the set, although it looks like they did.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title"><b>4. Lucy’s reel-and-real-life childbirth:</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">The episode where Lucy and Ricky welcomed little Ricky was aired on January 19, 1953. Forty-four million viewers (or 72% of the entire American household) tuned in to witness this joyous occasion. It was broadcast on the same date that Lucille gave birth to her son Desi Jr. in Los Angeles. The episode even beat the broadcast of Eisenhower’s presidential inauguration the next day (which drew 29 million viewers). The couple actually wrote Lucille’s real-life pregnancy into the show, and her scheduled real-life Caesarean childbirth was aligned with the date of her television character’s childbirth.</p>

     <h5 class="card-title"><b>2. Original producers wanted the show’s plot to be a mirror of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz’s real lives as celebrities:</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">However, both Lucille and Desi felt that their celebrity lives were something that the audience could not relate to. Instead, they decided that the plot be focused on an average American family.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>5. CBS didn’t think that Americans would want to see a TV show about an interracial couple:</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">In 1950, CBS asked Lucille to develop a television sitcom based on My Favorite Husband, the hit radio show which starred herself and Richard Denning. She agreed, but on one condition: that her real-life husband Desi be inlcuded the cast. CBS hesitated, and didn’t think that audiences would buy a sitcom about an all-American woman married to a Cuban with an odd accent. To prove CBS wrong, the couple embarked on a vaudeville tour which included Arnaz’s own orchestra. The act’s success finally convinced the CBS big bosses to sign the couple up. I Love Lucy not only proved to be a star vehicle for Lucille, but it also made a way to save their already shaky marriage.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>6. I Love Lucy was the first scripted television show to use a three-camera format in front of a studio audience:</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">Most television shows at that time were filmed in New York, and the show’s sponsor Philip Morris wanted I Love Lucy to be shot in the Big Apple. In those days, TV programs broadcast from coast to coast were yet unheard-of, and such shows could only be shown so far. As a result, West Coast audiences were only able to watch such shows taped in New York through kinescopes, which displayed inferior-quality pictures. Desi came up with the suggestion: the show should be shot with three cameras, which would provide the uniform quality picture for every market.</p>

   <h5 class="card-title"><b>7. The Great Grape Dilemma:</b></h5>
<p class="card-text">Lucille reportedly nearly choked to death while doing the grape stomping scene in the episode “Lucy’s Italian Movie.” No one noticed it until the episode was done filming.</p>
